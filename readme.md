# Object Oriented Deep Learning in Matlab

This is my attempt to implement a deep neural networks in matlab (in 2012, before TensorFlow, Pythorch, etc.).

I developed this code for my marster thesis, "Distance perserving hashing for biometric data".

This system trains deep neural networks such that:
  1. Map different images from a user close together in the hash space
  2. Map images of different users far aprt in hash space
  
I used AT&T face dataset for training this version of the code.
